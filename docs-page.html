                  Customer service is the support we offer to our customers —
                  both before and after they buy and use our products — that
                  helps them have an easy, enjoyable experience with our brand.
                  But customer service is more than solving a customer’s
                  problems and closing tickets. customer service means
                  delivering proactive and immediate support to customers
                  anytime on the channel of their choice — phone, email, text,
                  chat, and more.

                  Status log helps us to understand whether an order is still in
                  process or dispatched / invoiced.

              <section class="docs-intro">
                <p>
                  Inventory refers to the products that are ready to sell, along
                  with the raw materials that are used to produce them. There
                  are three general categories of inventory, including raw
                  materials (any supplies that are used to produce finished
                  products), work-in-progress (WIP), and finished products or
                  those that are ready for sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inventory management allows businesses to minimize inventory
                  costs as they create or receive products on an as-needed
                  basis.
                </p>
                <p>Inventory is divided according to two types of lenses</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Stock Lens (Finished Lens)</li>
                  <li>RX Lens (Semi Finished Lens)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Stock Lens (Finished Lens)</h4>
                <p>
                  These lenses are pre-manufactured with a certain base curve,
                  prescription and blank size. The lenses are then coated with
                  anti-glare, anti-scratch or both(As per customer requirement),
                  and packaged for retail.
                </p>

                <h4>RX Lens (Semi Finished Lens)</h4>
                <p>
                  Semi-finished lens is the raw blank lens used to produce the
                  most individualized RX lens according to the customer’s
                  requirement. Different prescription powers request for
                  different semi-finished lens types or base curves, it goes
                  through multiple processes (Surfacing, Coating, Tinting etc)
                  Depending on requirement of particular order.

                <li>Manual Packing</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Automatic Packing</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Average Packing time: One person takes 3 hours to pack 1000
                  pcs using Autopacker machine, Depending on number of types of
                  lenses contained in a consignment (Colour and Coating) this
                  process takes more or less time (since manual intervention is
                  required while inputting type)
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition, certain customer require different envelopes for
                  different types, so that change also needs to be made
                  manually.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Manual Packing</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Average Packing Time: One Person takes 6 hours to pack 1000
                  pcs
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certain customers (lower %) demand manual packing of lenses
                  and this/ process take double the time of automatic packing.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Scanning (By Barcode Scanner)</h4>

                  pcs
                </li>
                <li>
                  This is the maximum efficiency i.e. where the barcodes are
                  just on the top of the envelope and so the entire envelope
                  does not need to be lifter for scanning.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>In Box Arrangement</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This process is used to arrange the packed lens boxes and it

                  Lens production involves a series of steps that transform raw
                  materials into a finished lens product. after receiving the
                  blank lenses from the inventory, the next step is Surfacing.

              <h2 class="section-heading">Surfacing</h2>
              <p>
                Surfacing is the process by which prescription is placed onto a
                lens and preparing its surface prior to being cut for the frame.
              </p>
              <p>There are two types of techniques used for surfacing</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Traditional Surfacing</li>
                <li>Digital Surfacing</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>Traditional surfacing</strong> techniques involve the
                process of grinding and polishing the lenses to their desired
                prescription and finish. The process involves shaping the lens
                using specialized grinding machines and polishing it to remove
                any roughness or imperfections on the surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Digital Surfacing</strong> is a lens making process that
                removes the hard tooling limitations of traditional surfacing.
                with digital surfacing, labs can produce unlimited shapes and
                exceptional accuracy on one or two surfaces of the lens to
                achieve the intended design.
              </p>
              <p>Surfacing is done in following steps:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Calculation</li>
                <li>Unpacking and Blank checking</li>
                <li>Taping</li>
                <li>Blocking</li>
                <li>Generation</li>
                <li>Engraving (In Digital Surfacing)</li>
                <li>Smoothing (In Traditional Surfacing)</li>
                <li>Polishing</li>
                <li>D-Blocking</li>
              </ol>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Lens Calculation system</h2>
              <p>
                Calculating the Precal and Non Precal order, Precal is a lens
                calculation process which predetermines the thickness of a
                glazed lens, based on frame shape, prescription and centration.
                Precal calculates the minimum centre thickness to which a lens
                can be surfaced to provide the thickness appropriate to the
                lens/ mount combination. The Precal calculation will only be
                applied when specified by the customer or when stock lenses
                cannot be used due to the frame type e.g. semi-rimless (supra)
                or rimless mounts.

                  lens production that involves refining the surface of the lens
                  to achieve the desired shape and smoothness. This step is
                  typically performed after the lens has been ground to the
                  correct curvature and prescription.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Smoothing is removing the grinding marks from the surface of
                  the semi finished lens without changing its curvature. Here
                  the lens is brought to the exact curve required and surface is
                  smoothened not to have any mark or scratches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The goal of the smoothing process is to achieve a smooth and
                  uniform surface on the lens, with no visible scratches, pits,
                  or other imperfections that could affect the visual quality of
                  the final product. This step is critical to achieving a
                  high-quality lens that meets the required specifications for
                  the prescription and curvature.

                  QC (quality control) is a crucial aspect that ensures the
                  lenses meet the required standards of optical clarity,
                  precision, and durability. to ensure that lenses do not have
                  any surface defect, have the right thickness and accurate
                  power; stringent quality check is done using high-end

                Surfacing QC involves inspecting the lens after it has been
                ground and polished to its final shape.
              </p>
              <p>During this process, the lens undergoes three steps:</p>

                  <h3>Lens Checking</h3>

                  <p>
                    Each lenses undergoes pre quality checks after surfacing to
                    ensure all quality parameters as per ISO 14889 & 8980 STDs.
                    In Quality VRX uses high precession & reliable instruments
                    like Focovision & Automapper from Automation & Robotics and
                    LM600 from Nidek.

                    Optical, Cosmetic & Geometrical parameters along with
                    contactless thickness measurements. The inbuilt Dual Mapping
                    is important for inspection of whole surface and meaning
                    full process control. It works by Reflection i.e. Lens
                    Positioning & Tilt & by Transmission for Optical mapping for
                    accurate inspection of Single Vision & Progressive lenses.
                    This ensure utmost performance of lens designs.

                  Tinting is the process of adding a color or shading to the
                  lens material to achieve specific optical properties or
                  cosmetic effects. Tinting is done on lenses for UV protection and to protect eyes
                  from glare of sun, tinting can also be used for fashion purposes or to help individuals with certain eye conditions, such as light sensitivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the tinting process chemical (Dye) are prepared and the
                  process takes place in hot bath of dyes along with lenses to
                  obtain the color as required. Lenses undergo dyeing in dark
                  colors and the colored lenses protect the glare of sun from
                  reaching to the eyes.

              <p>
                The Tinting of lenses is a wet & hot process in which the lenses
                are immersed in hot liquid dyes, the heat opens the small pores
                of the lenses and colored dyed particles impregnate the surface
                of the lenses, making the lenses to achieve the color of the
                dyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                After tinting of lenses, colored lenses are compared with a pre-
                approved sample to ensure it has been made as per requirement.
              </p>

              <h3>Procedure for Rx/ Stock Tinting</h3>
              <p>
                Rx/ Stock tinting refers to the process of adding color to a
                lens to change its appearance or to enhance its performance. The
                procedure for Rx/ Stock tinting generally involves the following
                steps:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Preparation of Machine</h4>
                  <p>
                    Pre- Heat clean machine tanks filled with water for 30 mins
                    → Tank temperature should reach 80°c, for adding the color
                    and take care to stir the water to mix the dyes for
                    homogeneity of color & machine temperature should reach at
                    93°c to start the production (checked with digital
                    thermometer) → Detergent tank is cleaned in every shift.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p>
                    Cosmetic Check of all incoming lens is done in Tint before
                    production starts → Color wise segregation of material →
                    Color wise batch preparation as per basket size/catcher →
                    all lenses are cleaned in detergent bath for 10 Seconds
                    (Commercial detergent- Fena Brand) → all lenses are cleaned
                    in DI water for around 5 Sec→ processed for doing tinting
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

                  <p>
                    Lens are dipped for 15-20 mins in the hot bath for the
                    respective color (Temp- 93 °c & above) → they are checked
                    for shade %, if within tolerance then that go for pair
                    matching of individual order in BPI machine manually. Coated
                    orders should have additional tinting around 4%-5%, as
                    leaching of tint color take place in hard coat
                  </p>
                  <h5>If shade is not achieved</h5>
                  <p>

                  In the lens manufacturing process, coating refers to the
                  application of thin, transparent layers of material onto the
                  surface of the lens. Coatings are used in lens manufacturing
                  for a variety of reasons, including to enhance the performance
                  and durability of the lens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some common types of lens coatings include Hard
                  (scratch-resistant) coatings, which make the lens more durable
                  and resistant to damage, and Anti-Reflective coatings, which
                  reduce glare and improve visual clarity.

              <p>
                Scratch resistant coating or hard coating provide lenses with
                durability and increased longevity. A high quality thermally
                cured hardcoat provides the best scratch resistance and provides
                for the most durable ingredient for an AR coating application.
                Plastic lens materials scratch easily than glass materials, and
                therefore benefit greatly with application of a durable
                hardcoat.

                  <p>
                    As per the requirement lenses comes from different
                    departments for hard coating process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some stocks lenses comes directly from Finish store, some
                    lenses comes from Surface QC or from Tint department

                <li><h4>Index/Coating wise segregation</h4></li>
                <p>
                  Lenses are segregated according to the index of the lens or
                  the type of coating to be done on them. Lens index is a number
                  that describes how thick or thin your lenses are. The higher a
                  lens' index is, the thinner it becomes. Higher prescriptions
                  require higher index lenses, while lower prescriptions require
                  lower index lenses.
                </p>

                <li>
                  <h4>Lens cleaning and Lens loading in lensholder</h4>
                  <p>
                    The surface of the lens is cleaned and prepared to remove
                    any dirt, oil, or other contaminants that may interfere with
                    the hard coating process. This step is important to ensure
                    that the coating adheres properly to the lens surface. then
                    the lens is loaded into lensholader

                  <h4>Lens loading in machine</h4>
                  <p>
                    The lens is then loaded into a specialized vacuum chamber
                    that is designed for hard coating. The chamber is sealed and
                    the air is evacuated to create a vacuum.

                <li>
                  <h4>Deposition</h4>
                  <p>
                    The hard coating material is then vaporized inside the
                    vacuum chamber using an electric charge or a heat source.
                    The vaporized material condenses onto the surface of the
                    lens to form a thin, uniform layer.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Lens unloading</h4>
                  <p>
                    Lens unloading typically involves removing the coated lens
                    from the vacuum chamber after the coating has been applied.

                  <p>
                    The coated lens is then heated to a specific temperature for
                    a specific time period to allow the coating to settle and
                    cure properly. Lens curing process helps to ensure that the
                    hard coating adheres properly to the surface of the lens and
                    achieves the desired level of hardness.

                  <p>
                    Once the hard coating process is complete, the coated lens
                    is inspected for any defects, such as bubbles or unevenness
                    in the coating. The coating thickness is also checked to
                    ensure that it meets the desired specifications.

                  <h4>Transfer as per coating</h4>
                  <p>
                    If Hard Multi-Coating is required, the lens is sent to a
                    multi coating lab.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Hard Multi-Coating is not required, the lens is sent
                    directly to the final QC.

              <p>
                In lens production, HMC (Hard Multi-Coat) is a type of coating
                that is commonly applied to the surface of lenses. HMC coatings
                can improve the visual performance of eyeglasses by reducing
                unwanted reflections, and improving contrast.
              </p>
              <h3>Anti-Reflection Coating</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    An Anti-reflection coating is a type of optical coating
                    applied to the surface of lenses to reduce reflection. The
                    primary benefit is the elimination of the reflection itself
                    which makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Another benefit of AR coating is to reduce glare of light,
                    which is particularly noticeable when driving at night or
                    working in front of a computer monitor. The decreased glare
                    means that wearers often find their eyes are less tired,
                    particularly at the end of the day.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Allowing more light to pass through the lens also increases
                    contrast and therefore increases visual clarity.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Anti-reflection lenses include an additional coating that
                    repels water and oil, making them easier to keep clean.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Present Anti Reflection coatings are also having an
                    Anti-Static property which repels dusts and in turn
                    generates less scratch while cleaning.

                    (Anti Scratch coating) which acts as a buffer cushioning
                    layer.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    This coating is getting applied on lenses inside a high
                    vacuum chamber. An Ion Gun is used to make the lenses
                    surface rough. This roughening is needed for good adhesion
                    of AR coating.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Then some coating materials (Silicon Oxide, Zirconium Oxide,
                    Indium Tin Oxide etc.) gets deposited in alternate layers to
                    achieve the required properties. At last the hydrophobic
                    material gets deposited.
                  </p>

                  Flipping: The lens is typically held in a specialized fixture
                  or tool that allows it to be flipped over without touching the
                  surface of the lens. The coating is then applied to the other
                  side of the lens.
